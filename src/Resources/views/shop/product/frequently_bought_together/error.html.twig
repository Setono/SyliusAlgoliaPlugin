        <p>This is most likely because of one of two reasons:</p>
        <p><strong>1) The recommendation index was not created. Follow these instructions</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to <a href="https://www.algolia.com/dashboard" target="_blank">Algolia dashboard</a></li>
            <li>Click on <strong>Recommend</strong></li>
            <li>Click on <strong>Start using</strong> on the Frequently Bought Together</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <strong>2) There is not enough data to show recommendations for this specific product.</strong>
            You can test this by going to the <a href="https://www.algolia.com/dashboard" target="_blank">Algolia dashboard</a>
            and clicking the <strong>Recommend</strong>, choosing your model and input the name '{{ product.name }}'
            into the preview field
        </p>
        <p><strong>Error message</strong></p>
        <pre>{{ error }}</pre>
